      <h2>Lizards are awesome</h2>

      <p>Lizards are the largest groups in the reptile family, with over 6,000 members! They include all reptiles, apart from snakes.</p>

        <p>There are huge variations in the lizard family, with members from as small as a half an inch to 10 feet long! Some are herbivores, some are omnivores, and some are exclusively carnivores.
        
        <p>So much variation means lots of fun quirks â€“ here are some cool lizard facts. </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Some species of lizard, such as the Chameleon or the Anole can change color at will.</li>
        <li>The Basilisk Lizard can run on water. It rears up and uses flaps of skin on the toes of its hind legs to give it more surface area. This also creates air pockets that keep it afloat as long as it stays up to about 5 feet per second.</li>
        <li>Chameleons can move their eyeballs independently so they can see in two different directions at the same time, which gives them a 360-degree view around themselves.</li>
        <li>The Draco lizard is the only reptile that glides. The folds of skin on their elongated ribs act as wings, which the lizard grabs with its forelimbs. This allows it to fly up to 100 feet between trees.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Lizards are found all over the world in almost every type of terrain. Some live in trees; others prefer to live in vegetation on the ground, while others live in deserts among rocks. Most lizards are active during the day. Lizards are cold-blooded animals, which means they rely on their environment to help warm their bodies. </p>
